## Description

From the state of Michigan's website:

*PFAS are a large group of man-made chemicals that include
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS).
PFAS have been used globally during the past century in manufacturing,
firefighting and thousands of common household and other consumer
products. These chemicals are persistent in the environment and in the
human body -- meaning they don't break down and they can accumulate over
time. In recent years, experts have become increasingly concerned by the
potential effects of high concentrations of PFAS on human health.*

PFAS contamination in West Michigan has unfortunately made
[headlines](https://www.wzzm13.com/article/news/local/judge-approves-54m-settlement-kent-co-residents-wolverine-3m-pfas-case/69-091ea42c-125a-4341-8ea0-238fdac4d06e),
reminiscent of other environmental advocacy efforts like that of
renowned whistleblower [Erin
Brockovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Brockovich).

There are multiple PFAS-related data sets available from the state of
Michigan contained in a single zipped file on
[GitHub](https://github.com/dilernia/STA418-518/blob/main/Data/pfas_data.zip)

1.  **Surface water sampling data**; PFAS concentrations in surface
    water samples üèûüêü

2.  **Public water supply sampling data**; PFAS concentrations in
    municipal drinking water samples üíßü´ó

3.  **PFAS sites data** ; PFAS contamination or investigation sites of
    interest ‚ò¢Ô∏èüè≠

### Public water supply sampling data

From the [EGLE
website](https://www.michigan.gov/egle/maps-data/mpart-pfas-gis):

*The public water supply results include information from both the State
of Michigan funded drinking water Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances
(PFAS) sampling effort, and ongoing PFAS compliance monitoring of public
water supplies in Michigan. It includes, but is not limited to, sample
location, sample date, and sample results...*

*The combined public water supply results data is representative of the
PFAS sampling locations, with each location having multiple samples
taken, dates for each sample, and the analytical results for each
sample.*
